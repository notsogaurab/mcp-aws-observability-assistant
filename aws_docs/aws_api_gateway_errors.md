        A 5xx error in AWS API Gateway indicates an issue with your backend integration. This could be a Lambda function, EC2 instance, or another AWS service.

        **Common Causes:**
        * **Lambda Timeout:** Your integrated Lambda function took longer than its configured timeout. Check Lambda execution logs in CloudWatch.
        * **Backend Unreachable:** The backend service (e.g., EC2 instance) is not reachable by API Gateway. Check VPC security groups, network ACLs, and routing.
        * **Malformed Response from Backend:** The backend returned a response that API Gateway couldn't understand or map.
        * **Internal Server Error in Backend:** The backend application itself threw an uncaught exception.
        * **Concurrency Limits:** Lambda concurrency limits reached.

        **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        1.  **Check CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway:** Look for `Execution Errors` and `Integration Errors`.
        2.  **Check CloudWatch Logs for Backend:** If using Lambda, check its logs for exceptions or timeouts.
        3.  **Verify Integration Request/Response Mappings:** Ensure your API Gateway integration is correctly configured to send/receive data from the backend.
        4.  **Test Backend Directly:** Bypass API Gateway and test the backend (e.g., invoke Lambda directly, access EC2 endpoint) to isolate the problem.
        5.  **Review IAM Permissions:** Ensure API Gateway has permission to invoke Lambda or access other backend services.
